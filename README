# Level-IP

Level-IP is a Linux userspace TCP/IP stack, implemented with TUN/TAP devices.

The main goals are to:
* Learn TCP/IP
* Learn Linux systems/network programming
* Learn Linux Socket API

The results of the learning experience will be accompanied by explanatory blog posts. 

Major shoutout to Xiaochen Wang, whose implementation is a major source of inspiration to this project. I find his source code easy to understand and some of my design was copied from his implementation. See https://github.com/chobits/tapip
